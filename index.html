    <p style="font-size: 25px;height: auto">&nbsp;Hi my name is Samantha Cortes, and I am a student at El Camino High school. I live here in Oceanside California, and I am experienced in Graphic Design and Web design. I am very creative and very passionate about art and other creative things, for example I am in ADV Orchestra. As you can see I am passionate of the fine arts and I look forward to creating new Websites and new things in photo shop. My services are also very affordable! :D</p>
	 <p style="font-size: 20px;height: auto">&nbsp; In this page I started by creating my banner and the design on the boarder by using external CSS. I added an image and created a boarder using HTML for both things. For the Navigatin, I used HTML to link the difference pages, and put it inside a div so I could style it with external CSS, same with the buttons at the bottom.</p>
