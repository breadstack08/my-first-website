    </h2>
    <p style="height: auto; font-size: 20px">&nbsp; &nbsp; My name is Samantha Cortes, and I am currently a student at ECHS. I have experience in making websites, and exploring different things in photoshop. I enjoy working in the creative arts, such as graphic design, digital and traditional art, as well as music. I have been doing art since I was a child, and I have had experience with graphic design since freshmen year in high school, and I have done web design in sophomore year, and I have done music since 6th grade, but I plan on pursuing law for my main career.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
	
	<div style="float: right;"><img src="hollowknightgameyay.jpg"  alt="Hollow knight characters" style="height: 200px;"><div style="border: thin solid; width: 373px; text-align:center ">Image I made of my favorite characters fom hollow knight using Photo Shop!</div></div>
	
	<p style="height: auto; font-size: 20px">&nbsp; &nbsp; In my free time I enjoy hanging out with my family and friends, for example,&nbsp; going out to the mall, or doing some volunteer work. But when I am not with them, I enjoy spending time by myself doing some art, or playing some of my favorite video games (like LOZ Breath of the wild, or Hollow knight (1st and 2nd game)). I have 2 Chihuahuas at home of which I love them both dearly. Over all I value mysef, amd my family above anything (including my dogs).</p>
    <p style="height: auto; font-size: 20px">&nbsp; &nbsp;I am a Latina, I was born and raised in the U.S.A, making me a First Generation American, and I have faced my share of struggles. I have gone through life exploring more about my culture, and taking in appreciation to the creativity and strong personality my culture has provided me. I thank my parents for coming here to give me a better life, and raising me to be a strong individua.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="height: auto; font-size: 20px">&nbsp; &nbsp; So in summary,&nbsp;I'm a proud Latina with a deep appreciation for art and creativity, which has guided my experience in both web and graphic design. Born and raised in the U.S., I value strong family connections, quality time with friends, and the joy my two dogs bring to daily life. As I prepare to pursue a career in law, I bring a thoughtful, well-rounded perspective shaped by my cultural roots, creative passions, and commitment to personal growth.</p>
	<p style="height: auto; font-size: 15px">How I made this page: I Used CSS so that the style of the page (backround, boarder, tittle, navigation) would stay the same, and used HTML to add in the image and the paragraphs. </p>
